Hello World! Welcome to my small corner of the internet.

This is my first story on this blog, so I’ll keep it simple and just introduce myself and why I made this site.

My name is Yasin. I’ve worked before as a system operations engineer and as a software engineer, mostly on the backend side. My main stack has been PHP/Laravel and Node.js, working on APIs and services behind the scenes. I’m still learning and improving, so this blog is also part of that process.

I built this website with Gatsby. I chose it because I like the idea of a simple static site: just code, no big server to manage. I can deploy it for free on Cloudflare without paying for traditional hosting, and it stays quite lightweight. Free hosting is sometimes unreliable, but for a static blog like this, it’s good enough for me.

Right now the blog does not use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Each post is just an .mdx file in a GitHub repo. When I want to publish something, I write a file, push it, and the site updates. If one day I need more complex data, Gatsby’s GraphQL layer is there as an option.

I also want to say thank you to Brian Ruiz for open-sourcing the project this site is based on:

His work saved me a lot of time. I didn’t have to design everything from zero. I could start from his clean Medium-style layout and then slowly change things to match my preferences.

My plan for this blog is simple:
– Share my projects and experiments
– Build a small portfolio in one place
– Link it on my CV so recruiters and future colleagues can see what I do

I’ll probably post about university projects, personal side projects, and some things I try just for fun. Besides that, I want to write about topics related to my background and skills: backend development, system operations, and anything around software and infrastructure that I find useful. If even a few posts are helpful to someone else, I’ll be happy.

The blog is still very basic, and I will keep adjusting it over time. If you are reading this first story, thank you for visiting. I hope you can get something useful from what I share here.

See you in the next post.
