This website is one of those beginnings. My name is Yasin. I worked as a system operations engineer and as a backend software engineer, mostly with PHP/Laravel, Python and Node.js. I’ve spent years working behind the scenes, building APIs and services that power other things. But this blog isn’t about listing what I’ve done. It’s about learning out loud, sharing what I know, and writing through the things I’m still figuring out along the way.

I like keeping things simple, so I built this site with Gatsby. There’s no heavy server or complicated setup, just code that runs quietly and freely on Cloudflare. It’s true that free hosting isn’t perfect, but for a small static blog like this, it feels right. Everything here lives in a GitHub repository, and each post is just an .mdx file. When I want to publish something new, I write, push, and watch the site update. It’s a clean, almost peaceful process.

Thanks to the design, started with the open-source project by [Brian Ruiz](https://github.com/BrianRuizy/gatsby-medium-blog), whose work saved me many hours. His layout gave me a solid foundation and a Medium-like clarity that I slowly shaped to make my own. My plan for this space is simple: to share projects and technical experiments, to keep a small portfolio of what I build, and to write about the systems and ideas that keep me curious. I’ll probably talk about backend development, system operations, and the parts of security engineering that connect both. Maybe I’ll include a few university projects or personal experiments too.

Right now, the blog is still basic but It’s a work in progress, and that’s what makes it interesting. If you’re reading this first post, thank you for visiting. I hope you find something useful here. Something that helps, sparks an idea, or simply stays with you for a little while. See you in the next post.
